# Fermax Blue for Home Assistant

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

Home Assistant custom integration for **Fermax Blue** video door entry systems (DUOX PLUS / blueStream).

This integration simulates a Fermax Blue mobile app client, connecting to the Fermax cloud API and receiving real-time push notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging when someone rings your doorbell.

## Features

- **Live video streaming** — Real-time MJPEG video from the intercom camera (~720x480, ~24fps). The card auto-switches between static preview and live stream.
- **Camera preview** — Last captured frame persists across HA restarts, always visible in the camera card
- **Doorbell detection** — Real-time push notification when someone rings (via Firebase Cloud Messaging)
- **Door opening** — Open your building's door remotely (lock entity + button)
- **On-demand camera** — Triggers the intercom camera without a doorbell ring via auto-on
- **F1 auxiliary button** — Trigger the intercom's F1 function
- **Call guard** — Call the building's guard/janitor
- **Do Not Disturb** — Toggle DND mode per device (useful for night automations)
- **Photo caller control** — Enable/disable automatic visitor photo capture
- **Opening history** — Track who opened the door and when
- **Connection status** — Monitor if your intercom is online (entities go unavailable when offline)
- **WiFi signal** — Track the intercom's wireless signal strength
- **Notification control** — Enable/disable doorbell notifications
- **Media browser** — Browse doorbell photos and call recordings from the HA media browser
- **Diagnostics** — Built-in troubleshooting data (with redacted credentials)
- **Configurable polling** — Adjust the status polling interval (1-30 minutes)

## Supported Devices

Tested with:
- Fermax VEO-XL WiFi DUOX PLUS
- Fermax VEO-XS WiFi DUOX PLUS (REF: 9449)

Should work with any Fermax Blue-compatible intercom (devices that work with the Fermax Blue / DuoxMe mobile app).

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to **Integrations** > **Custom repositories**
3. Add this repository URL with category **Integration**
4. Search for "Fermax Blue" and install
5. Restart Home Assistant
6. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Add Integration** > **Fermax Blue**

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from GitHub
2. Copy the `custom_components/fermax_blue` folder to your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Add Integration** > **Fermax Blue**

## Configuration

The integration is configured through the Home Assistant UI:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for **Fermax Blue**
4. Enter your Fermax Blue app credentials (see below)

The integration will automatically discover all paired devices on your account.

### Options

After setup, you can configure the integration options:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Configure** on your Fermax Blue integration
3. Available options:
   - **Polling interval** (1-30 minutes, default: 5)
   - **Recording retention** (1-90 days, default: 10) — auto-deletes older call recordings
   - **Auto-respond to doorbell** — when enabled, answers the call automatically: starts video stream, sends audio file through the intercom speaker, records the call to MP4. When disabled, only triggers notifications without interacting with the intercom
   - **Audio file path** — WAV/MP3 file for auto-response (e.g., `/config/media/mi_mensaje.wav`)

### API Credentials

During setup, after entering your Fermax Blue username and password, you will be asked for the **API and Firebase credentials**. These values are needed to communicate with Fermax's servers and receive push notifications.

The integration requires:
- **Fermax API**: Auth URL, Base URL, Auth Basic header (OAuth client credentials)
- **Firebase**: API Key, Sender ID, App ID, Project ID, Package Name

A `credentials.example.json` file is included as a template. Copy it to `credentials.json` and fill in your values.

#### How to Obtain Credentials

##### Firebase credentials (from the APK)

The Firebase credentials can be extracted automatically from the official Fermax Blue Android APK:

1. **Download the Fermax Blue APK** from your device or a trusted source (e.g., Softonic)
2. **Run the extraction script:**
   ```bash
   make extract-credentials APK=/path/to/fermax-blue.apk
   ```
   Or directly: `python scripts/extract_credentials.py /path/to/fermax-blue.apk`
3. The script extracts Firebase credentials from `resources.arsc` and API URLs from the binary. It also attempts to generate the OAuth `Basic` header from `OAuthUtils.java` and `Urls.java` if a JADX output directory is found alongside the APK.

The script reliably finds: `firebase_api_key`, `firebase_sender_id`, `firebase_app_id`, `firebase_project_id`, `firebase_package_name`, `fermax_auth_url`, and `fermax_base_url`.

##### OAuth client credentials (fermax_auth_basic)

The OAuth `client_id` and `client_secret` are encrypted in the Android app and combined by `OAuthUtils.getAuthorizationHeader()` into the `Basic` auth header used for login. When a decompiled JADX directory is available, `scripts/extract_credentials.py` prefers this source:

- `com.fermax.blue.app.core.utils.OAuthUtils.getAuthorizationHeader()`
- `com.fermax.blue.app.data.remoteconfig.Urls.clientId()`
- `com.fermax.blue.app.data.remoteconfig.Urls.clientSecret()`

The production values should match the production URLs `oauth-pro-duoxme.fermax.io` and `pro-duoxme.fermax.io`.

Do not use unrelated `Basic` headers from tracing or observability code. In particular, `TraceManagerOtelImpl.java` and `/monitoring/v1/traces` refer to telemetry, not OAuth login, and those headers will cause OAuth `invalid_client` errors.

Never publish `credentials.json`, generated `Basic` headers, Firebase keys, access tokens, refresh tokens, usernames, or passwords.

The OAuth credentials were identified thanks to the work of the open-source Fermax community:

- [fermax-blue-intercom](https://github.com/marcosav/fermax-blue-intercom) by @marcosav
- [hass-bluecon](https://github.com/AfonsoFGarcia/hass-bluecon) by @AfonsoFGarcia and the [fork](https://github.com/patrikulus/hass-bluecon) by @patrikulus
- [HASS-BlueCon](https://github.com/cvc90/HASS-BlueCon) by @cvc90
- [Fermax-Blue-Intercom](https://github.com/cvc90/Fermax-Blue-Intercom) by @cvc90

This integration exists thanks to the reverse-engineering work of these developers. If you find this project useful, please consider starring their repositories.

##### Manual extraction (fallback)

If the script doesn't find all values, decompile the APK with JADX and search manually:

1. **API URLs**: search for `oauth/token` and `fermax.io` in `Urls.java`
2. **OAuth Basic header**: inspect `OAuthUtils.getAuthorizationHeader()` and `Urls.clientId()` / `Urls.clientSecret()`. Select the production environment that corresponds to `oauth-pro-duoxme.fermax.io` / `pro-duoxme.fermax.io`, decrypt the encrypted byte arrays from those methods, URL-encode both values, join them as `client_id:client_secret`, then base64 encode that string and prefix it with `Basic `. Ignore telemetry headers from `TraceManagerOtelImpl.java`.
3. **Firebase**: found in `google-services.json` inside the APK:
   - `firebase_api_key` → `client[0].api_key[0].current_key`
   - `firebase_sender_id` → `project_info.project_number`
   - `firebase_app_id` → `client[0].client_info.mobilesdk_app_id`
   - `firebase_project_id` → `project_info.project_id`
   - `firebase_package_name` → `client[0].client_info.android_client_info.package_name`

> **Legal note:** These credentials are part of a publicly distributed application. Extracting configuration from software you own as a paying customer for personal interoperability use is a legitimate exercise of your consumer rights.

### Dedicated User for Doorbell Notifications (Recommended)

Fermax Blue only allows **one active push notification token per user**. If you use your main account for the integration, your mobile app will stop receiving doorbell notifications (or vice versa).

To solve this, **create a dedicated user** for the integration:

1. Open the **Fermax Blue app** on your phone
2. Go to **Settings** > **Users** > **Invite user**
3. Enter a new email address (e.g., `yourname+ha@gmail.com` — Gmail `+` aliases work)
4. The invited user will receive an email with a registration link
5. Open the link, **download the Fermax Blue app** on any phone, and complete the registration with a password
6. Once registered, you can uninstall the app — the account is now active
7. Use this new account's credentials when configuring the integration in Home Assistant

This way, your main account keeps receiving notifications on your phone, and the integration receives them independently via its own account.

> **Note:** If you skip this step and use your main account, the integration will still work for door opening, device status, and camera — but real-time doorbell notifications may conflict with your mobile app.

## Entities

For each paired intercom device, the integration creates:

| Entity | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `camera.<name>_visitor` | Camera | Live MJPEG stream when active; last frame as preview when idle |
| `event.<name>_doorbell` | Event | Fires when someone rings the doorbell |
| `event.<name>_door_opened` | Event | Fires when a door is successfully opened |
| `event.<name>_camera_on` | Event | Fires when camera preview / live stream starts |
| `binary_sensor.<name>_connection` | Binary Sensor | Device connectivity (entities go unavailable when disconnected) |
| `lock.<name>_<door>_lock` | Lock | Lock/unlock (open) the door |
| `button.<name>_<door>_open` | Button | One-press door opening |
| `button.<name>_camera_preview` | Button | Start camera preview / live stream |
| `button.<name>_f1` | Button | F1 auxiliary function |
| `button.<name>_call_guard` | Button | Call the building's guard/janitor |
| `sensor.<name>_wifi_signal` | Sensor | WiFi signal strength (0-4 bars) |
| `sensor.<name>_status` | Sensor | Device activation status |
| `sensor.<name>_last_opening` | Sensor | Last door opening timestamp (with user, door, guest attributes) |
| `sensor.<name>_last_call` | Sensor | Last call/doorbell ring timestamp (with call_id, answered, recent_calls count) |
| `switch.<name>_notifications` | Switch | Enable/disable push notifications |
| `switch.<name>_dnd` | Switch | Do Not Disturb mode |
| `switch.<name>_photo_caller` | Switch | Enable/disable automatic visitor photos |
| `switch.<name>_ring_preview` | Switch | Live preview on ring (default: off) — starts a view-only video stream when someone rings, so the camera shows the current visitor within a few seconds. The call is never answered and keeps ringing; no audio is sent or received. Stops after the stream duration or when the call ends |

## Dashboard Card

A ready-to-use dashboard card template is included in [`blueprints/fermax_dashboard_card.yaml`](blueprints/fermax_dashboard_card.yaml). It provides a complete intercom control panel with:

- Live camera / preview image
- Door open + camera preview buttons
- F1 + call guard buttons
- Doorbell event, connection status, door lock
- DND, photo caller, notification switches
- WiFi signal + last opening info

**To use it:**

1. Install [mushroom-cards](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom) via HACS (for status indicators)
2. Copy the content of `blueprints/fermax_dashboard_card.yaml`
3. Edit your dashboard > Add card > Manual YAML
4. Paste and replace `DEVICE_NAME` and `DOOR` with your entity names

> **Tip:** To find your entity IDs, go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Fermax Blue** > click your device.

## Call Recordings

Every video stream session is automatically recorded to MP4 (video + intercom audio) in `/config/media/fermax_recordings/`. Doorbell visitor photos are saved as JPG in the same directory. Files are named with timestamps (e.g., `2026-04-06_13-00-00.mp4`, `2026-04-06_13-00-00_photo.jpg`).

Recordings and photos are automatically deleted after the retention period (default: 10 days, configurable in options).

### Media browser

All recordings and photos are browsable directly from the HA media browser via **Media** > **Fermax Blue**. Files are listed newest-first with thumbnails for photos and playback for videos.

You can also access them from the dashboard via the **Grabaciones** button, or browse **Media** > **Local media** > **fermax_recordings**.

## Services

### `fermax_blue.send_audio`

Send audio to the intercom speaker during an active video stream.

```yaml
# Send a pre-recorded audio file
service: fermax_blue.send_audio
data:
  audio_file: /config/media/mi_mensaje.wav

# Or send a TTS message
service: fermax_blue.send_audio
data:
  message: "Hola, ahora bajo"
  language: es
```

## Automation Blueprints

### Doorbell notification


A doorbell notification blueprint is available at [`blueprints/fermax_doorbell_notification.yaml`](blueprints/fermax_doorbell_notification.yaml).

### Cast doorbell to Google Nest

Show doorbell video on a Nest Hub and announce on speakers: [`blueprints/fermax_cast_doorbell.yaml`](blueprints/fermax_cast_doorbell.yaml). Supports optional auto-response to the intercom via TTS.

**To install:**

1. Copy `blueprints/fermax_doorbell_notification.yaml` to your HA `config/blueprints/automation/fermax_blue/` folder
2. Go to **Settings** > **Automations** > **Create Automation** > **Use Blueprint**
3. Select "Fermax: Doorbell notification"
4. Configure your doorbell event entity, camera, and notification service

The blueprint supports:
- Mobile push notification on doorbell ring
- Optional camera snapshot attachment
- Customizable title and message

## Automation Examples

### Flash lights when doorbell rings

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Flash lights on doorbell"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: event.fermax_your_home_doorbell
        attribute: event_type
    action:
      - service: light.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: light.hallway
        data:
          flash: long
```

### Enable Do Not Disturb at night

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "DND at night"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "23:00:00"
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.fermax_your_home_dnd

  - alias: "Disable DND in the morning"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "07:00:00"
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_off
        target:
          entity_id: switch.fermax_your_home_dnd
```

## How It Works

1. **Authentication**: The integration authenticates with the Fermax Blue cloud API (`pro-duoxme.fermax.io`) using your account credentials
2. **Device Discovery**: It fetches all paired intercom devices and their accessible doors
3. **Firebase Registration**: It registers a Firebase Cloud Messaging client (simulating the mobile app) to receive real-time doorbell push notifications
4. **Camera Preview**: The auto-on feature triggers the intercom camera. A push notification arrives with the media room ID and signaling server URL
5. **Video Streaming**: The integration connects to the Fermax mediasoup SFU via Socket.IO, negotiates WebRTC transport, and receives live video frames (~720x480) that are served as MJPEG to the HA frontend
6. **Push Notifications**: When someone rings your doorbell, Fermax sends a push notification via Firebase, which the integration receives instantly and acknowledges
7. **Frame Persistence**: The last video frame is saved to disk so the camera card always shows a preview, even after HA restarts
8. **Polling**: Device status (connection, signal, opening history) is polled at a configurable interval (default: 5 minutes)
9. **Retry Logic**: API calls are automatically retried with exponential backoff on transient errors (5xx, connection failures)

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid credentials" error
Make sure you're using the same email and password you use in the Fermax Blue mobile app. The password is case-sensitive.

If Home Assistant logs show OAuth `invalid_client`, the problem is usually the OAuth client credentials (`fermax_auth_basic`), not your Fermax user email/password. Re-run the extraction against a JADX decompiled directory so the script can generate the header from `OAuthUtils.java` and `Urls.clientId()` / `Urls.clientSecret()`. Do not use `Basic` headers found near `TraceManagerOtelImpl.java`, `/monitoring/v1/traces`, OpenTelemetry, tracing, or observability code.

If logs show `invalid_grant` or Home Assistant reports `invalid_auth`, the problem is more likely the Fermax account credentials, account state, or an account without access to paired devices.

### Doorbell notifications not working
The integration needs to register with Firebase Cloud Messaging. This happens automatically but can take a few minutes on first setup. Check the Home Assistant logs for `fermax_blue` entries.

### Camera shows no image
Press the "Camera preview" button to trigger the first stream. After that, the last frame will be saved and shown as preview even after restarts.

### Live video not working after upgrading
Live video is powered by `pymediasoup`/`aiortc`. On v0.16.8 these were temporarily **optional** because no `aiortc` release was compatible with the `av>=17` shipped by Home Assistant 2026.7 — live streaming was disabled on those systems. Since `aiortc` 1.15.0 (compatible with `av 17`) they are regular requirements again and live video works on all supported HA versions.

If live video is unavailable and the logs show a WARNING about missing streaming dependencies, restart Home Assistant so it installs the integration requirements. Everything else — doorbell detection, door opening, visitor photos, F1, DND, photo caller, call log — works normally even without them.

### Diagnostics
For troubleshooting, you can download diagnostics from **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Fermax Blue** > **3 dots menu** > **Download diagnostics**. Credentials are automatically redacted.

## Local Testing (CLI)

You can test every API feature locally without Home Assistant using the interactive CLI tool:

```bash
# Interactive mode (will prompt for credentials)
make cli

# Or pass credentials via environment variables
FERMAX_USER=your@email.com FERMAX_PASS=yourpassword make cli
```

This launches a Docker container with a menu-driven interface to test door opening, F1, call guard, DND, photo caller, opening history, camera preview, call log, and raw API calls.

No local Python installation needed — everything runs in Docker.

## Development

All development tools run via Docker — no local Python dependencies needed. Only Docker is required.
